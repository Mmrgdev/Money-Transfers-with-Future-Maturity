# Money-Transfers-with-Future-Maturity
This is a Smart contract that allows a user to transfer money with time maturity (money with a time locked).

The Monetary Transfer Smart contract allows a user to transfer money with time maturity. Once a user (the grantor) have registered the person or the group of people that will be the receivers of money (the beneficiaries), as well as, the amount of money and the date that they will receive the money (amount and time conditions), the Smart contract transfers the money when the conditions are satisfied.

This can be suitable for many uses case, like: for setting payments at specific time in the future, when a grantor wants to leave money to one or more beneficiaries, parents that want to lock some money for their kids (for example for paying the university when have passed X years), etc.
